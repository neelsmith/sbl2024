### Observations:

- In all three languages (Latin, Greek, and Hebrew), **God** (Deus, Θεός, אֱלֹהִים) is consistently the subject of the actions in these verses.
- The **verbs** describe different actions of God, primarily related to **speaking** (dixit, εἶπεν, וַיֹּאמֶר), **seeing** (vidit, εἶδεν, וַיַּרְא), and **creating** (creavit, ἐποίησεν, בָּרָא).
- Despite differences in language, the structure and meaning remain remarkably parallel across the Latin Vulgate, Greek Septuagint, and Hebrew Bible for these foundational Genesis verses.

This comparison highlights the close agreement in subject and verbal action across the translations of these significant passages.

### USER
Could add in parentheses next to each verb the dictionary form of the word (that is, the form you would look up to find the verb in a lexicon)?

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Here's the updated table with the dictionary form (lemma) of each verb included next to the respective verb in parentheses. This offers a more detailed view of the grammatical forms and will be useful when consulting a lexicon. The dictionary form is the form you'd typically look up in a dictionary or grammar reference for each language.

### USER
Can you isolate proper names in the first chapter of Genesis in Greek, Latin and Hebrew?

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Let’s isolate the **proper names** that appear in **Genesis 1** in the **Greek Septuagint (LXX)**, **Latin Vulgate**, and **Hebrew Bible (MT)**. In **Genesis 1**, the only proper names that consistently appear across these three versions are specific references to entities that closely resemble names (such as day labels or specific terms given a special identity).

### Proper Names in Genesis 1 (Greek, Latin, Hebrew):

1. **God / Elohim**  
    - **Greek Septuagint (LXX):** ὁ Θεός (ho Theos)  
    - **Latin Vulgate:** Deus  
    - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** אֱלֹהִים (Elohim)  

    - **Note:** While "Elohim" (God) can be understood grammatically as a plural form in Hebrew, it is consistently treated as a singular entity here referring to God in specific theological contexts.

2. **Light (Naming the Light "Day")**  
    - Note: God **calls** things into specific identities, which are treated with a nomenclature.
    
    - **Day**:

        - **Latin Vulgate:** dies  
        - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** יוֹם (yom)

3. **Darkness (Naming the Darkness "Night")**
    - **Night**:
        - **Greek Septuagint (LXX):** νύξ (nyx)  
        - **Latin Vulgate:** nox  
        - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** לַיִל (layil)

---

4. **Heaven (Naming the Firmament "Heaven")**
    - **Heaven**:
        - **Greek Septuagint (LXX):** οὐρανός (ouranos)  
        - **Latin Vulgate:** caelum  
        - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** שָׁמַיִם (shamayim)

---

5. **Earth (Naming the Dry Land "Earth")**  
    - **Earth**:
        - **Greek Septuagint (LXX):** γῆ (gē)  
        - **Latin Vulgate:** terra  
        - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** אֶרֶץ (eretz)

---

6. **Seas** (Naming the Gathered Waters "Seas")
    - **Seas**:
        - **Greek Septuagint (LXX):** θάλασσαι (thalassai)  
        - **Latin Vulgate:** maria  
        - **Hebrew Bible (MT):** יַמִּים (yamim)

### Summary:

Here’s a table summarizing these proper noun-like terms for reference:

| **Concept**            | **Greek Septuagint (LXX)**  | **Latin Vulgate** | **Hebrew Bible (MT)**  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **God**                | ὁ Θεός (ho Theos)            | Deus              | אֱלֹהִים (Elohim)      |
| **Day**                | ἡμέρα (hēmera)               | dies              | יוֹם (yom)             |
| **Night**              | νύξ (nyx)                    | nox               | לַיִל (layil)          |
| **Heaven / Sky**       | οὐρανός (ouranos)            | caelum            | שָׁמַיִם (shamayim)    |
| **Earth / Land**       | γῆ (gē)                      | terra             | אֶרֶץ (eretz)          |

### Important Notes:
- Words like **Light** (φῶς, lux, אוֹר) and **Darkness** (σκότος, tenebrae, חֹשֶׁךְ) are not typically considered proper names, though they are important in the first chapter of Genesis. However, **Day** and **Night** are treated more as proper designations when God names them.
- In this chapter, most proper names are **cosmological referents** (terms for "Heaven", "Earth", "Sea", etc.) rather than personal proper names like "Adam" or "Eve", which emerge later in Genesis.

This summary captures the use of significant terms in Genesis 1 that could be understood as **names** or given specific, non-generic identities across the three major translations (Greek, Latin, Hebrew).

### **Distinct Forms of בָּרָא in the Hebrew Bible:**

#### 1. **Perfect Forms** (Completed Action)
The **perfect** form in Hebrew generally expresses **a completed action**. In the case of **בָּרָא**, it mostly refers to **what God has already created**. It is used in the third-person singular descriptive of God's creative acts in the past or as a general statement.

- **בָּרָא** (*bara*) — **3rd person masculine singular perfect**  
  **Meaning:** "He created"  
  **Example:**

  **Meaning:** "And He created"  
  **Example:**  
  - **Genesis 1:27** — וַיִּבְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֶת־הָאָדָם֙ (*vayivra Elohim et ha-adam*): "And God **created** man..."

#### 4. **Participles** (Present Continuous or Noun Form)
The **participle** forms of **בָּרָא** can describe an entity that is **creating** (a creator), but in most cases, it maintains an emphasis on **continuous or habitual action**.

- **בּוֹרֵא** (*bore*) — **masculine singular participle**  
  **Meaning:** "The one who creates" or "Creator"  
  **Examples**:
  - **Isaiah 40:28** — **בּוֹרֵא קְצוֹת הָאָרֶץ** (*bore ketzot ha-aretz*): "The **Creator** of the ends of the earth."

- **נִבְרָא** (*nivre*) — **3rd person masculine singular, Nifal imperfect**  
  **Meaning:** "It was created" or "He was created"  
  **Example**:
  - **Psalm 89:13 (89:12 in most translations)** — **תָּבוֹר...כָּפָן יָמִין נִבְרָא** (*Tabor and Hermon... shall rejoice in Your name*): Here, nouns are described in terms of having been created.

- **נִבְרְאוּ** (*nivre'u*) — **3rd person plural, Nifal perfect**  
  **Meaning:** "They were created"  
  **Example**:  
  - **Isaiah 48:7** — **נִבְרְאוּ עַתָּ֖ה** (*nivre'u attah*): "They were **created** now, not long ago..."   

---

#### 6. **Infinitive Constructs**
The **infinitive** is used for a general or unspecific action, often corresponding to the English "-ing" form of verbs, as in "creating."

- **בְּרֹא** (*bero*) — **infinitive construct**  
  **Meaning:** "To create" or "when creating"  
  **Example:**  
  - **Genesis 2:4** — **בְּי֗וֹם בְּרֹ֛א אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶ֣רֶץ וְשָׁמָ֑יִם** (*beyom bero Elohim eretz ve-shamayim*): "In the day that the Lord God **created** the heavens and the earth..."
